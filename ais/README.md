# AIS Dataset Work

These notebooks were used for working with AIS data, which we decided to stop working on because the data was not as meaningful or useful as we originally expected. As a result of this, we decided to switch to the new heart disease set to work on our assignment.

## Business Cases for using AIS data:

- Analysing commodity availability
- Informing investment opportunities
- Monitoring illegal activity
- Shipping optimisation
- Emmisions monitoring
- Placement of infrastructure
- Managing vessell traffic
